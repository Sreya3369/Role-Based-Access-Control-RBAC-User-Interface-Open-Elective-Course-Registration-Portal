# Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-User-Interface-Open-Elective-Course-Registration-Portal

The course registration portal is designed to streamline the process of course enrollment. The portal includes two types of users: administrators and students. Both administrators and students can be added to the database as needed.

Admin Features:
Administrators can log in with their credentials to monitor all registered students. They can view details about students who have enrolled or not enrolled in specific courses. The admin dashboard displays students registered for a particular course in a department in an organized manner. Additionally, administrators have the authority to reset user passwords and send automated emails to students at their registered email addresses.

Student Features:
Students receive unique login credentials (user ID and password) from the administrator via email. Using these credentials, students can log in to the portal and select one course from various available branches and departments. Each course has a maximum seat limit, and once the limit is reached, the course will be automatically disabled for further registrations. Students who have not enrolled in any course will only be allowed to choose from courses with available seats. Once a student successfully registers for a course, they cannot change or reselect a course.

This system ensures an efficient and fair course registration process, accommodating multiple branches and courses while adhering to seatÂ limitations.
